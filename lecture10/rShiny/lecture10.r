# let's get started with rShiny
# all this is coming from: http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/

install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")


# make sure you've set your working directory so the "ourApp" folder is visible 
# then you can run:
runApp("ourApp")
runApp("ourApp", display.mode="showcase")

# the rest of rShiny is covered online
